A quick decription of what I did in Forage Internship with Mastercard. It was focused on phishing - creating a phishing email and presentation to share awareness in the company.

## Identify and Prevent Security Risks with Our Security Awareness Team

As an analyst in our Security Awareness Team, our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on us to educate our staff on identifying and reporting security threats, especially phishing attempts, which are a major risk to organizations today. Here’s a breakdown of what phishing entails and how we help combat it at Mastercard.

### What is Phishing?
Phishing involves pretending to be someone or something legitimate to obtain sensitive information, often targeting passwords or financial data. Attackers may:
- Send links or attachments designed to infect systems with malicious software.
- Lure recipients into providing sensitive information, such as financial data or login credentials.

Phishing attempts can have costly consequences, putting both Mastercard and its employees at risk. Therefore, we focus on safeguarding our business and our staff.

### Phishing Awareness at Mastercard
To mitigate phishing threats, Mastercard prioritizes educating our people on the risks and identification of phishing attempts. One key component of this education is through phishing simulation campaigns:
- **Monthly Testing**: Each month, we test our staff by sending a simulated phishing email that mimics real attacks.
- **Training Development**: We use the simulation results to improve our training, ensuring staff are well-prepared to spot phishing attempts.

### Sample Phishing Simulation Email
Below is an example of a simulated phishing email used to train our employees:

And my task was to make it more real:

**From:** security-notices@mastercard-support.com  
**To:** employee@email.com  
**Subject:** Password Reset Required

**Body:**
> Hello [Recipient's Name],  
> We have detected unusual activity on your account and believe it may have been compromised. For your security, please reset your password as soon as possible to prevent unauthorized access.  
>  
> To reset your password, please follow this link within the next 60 minutes to ensure continued access to your account:  
> [https://mastercard-secure-login.com/reset-password](https://mastercard-secure-login.com/reset-password)  
>  
> If you do not take action within the time frame, your account may be temporarily suspended for security reasons.  
>  
> **Important**: This link will expire in 60 minutes, so please act promptly. If you did not request this reset, please contact our IT support immediately at support@mastercard-support.com.  
>  
> Thank you for your immediate attention.  
>  
> Best regards,  
> Mastercard IT Support

## Next Task
To further strengthen awareness among employees about phishing threats, I’ve created a presentation to illustrate the risks, detection techniques, and proper reporting procedures.

I didn't want to paste the whole presentation here but it had 6 slides and I just pasted one of them:
